[Animendation](https://animendation.net/) is a website to share anime and manga recommendations.

## About

Animendation is a social network which allows you to:

- Link to your [Myanimelist](https://myanimelist.net/) account
- Build your own anime and manga recommendation list
- Follow other users and get updates on their recommendations
- Change the status of a series (plan to watch, watching, dropped, ...)

Most of the data is obtained from the [Myanimelist API](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig/references/api/v2) and the [Jikan API](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan). I want to thank for both of them, without them this project wouldn't be possible.

## Bugs and feature requests

Feel free to create an issue [here](https://github.com/mymatsubara/animendation/issues/new) if you found a bug or if you want to request a new feature!
